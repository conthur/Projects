Hello, welcome to my Bank Account Application Repositiory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This code was written in python, and it has been refactored in order to adhere to good
design principles. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to run the code, find the main file located at 
src/main/python/BankApp/main.py

The application will ask you for a card number and a pin, In order to access this you, 
must go to the helper function located at src/main/python/BankApp/helpers.py. There 
you can find a list called cards which contains dictionaries that have the information
needed to get into the application

I hope you enjoy - Connor Thurston
